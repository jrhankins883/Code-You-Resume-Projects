                    <a href="https://github.com/jrhankins883/Recipe-Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recipe Page</a> - In this little project I created, I just took the recipe 
                    for one of my favorite meals and made a simple recipe page. I tooled around with some JavaScript to make the page a little
                    interactive. Nothing special, but it was fun to create and mess around with.

                    <a href="https://github.com/jrhankins883/To-Do-App" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To Do App</a> - This is a project that I created with a coding friend who is
                    more experienced than I am and helped in the creation of this. My skills are reaching the point where I can create this on my 
                    own but this was an exercise he walked me through when I wanted help building something from the ground up.

                    project that I created for my Data Analysis Capstone Project. I compared the number of times Keanu Reeves says "Whoa" in his movies 
                    to the box office revenue for those movies to see if a high number of "Whoa's" equal box office success. Turns out, it doesn't. The average
                    moviegoer seems to prefer watching Reeves play a hero (as per the box office numbers) instead of a stoner. Who knew?
